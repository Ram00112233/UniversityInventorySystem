Hi, it's me Ram Karki so from this coding assignment I learned about the usage of core concepts of programming in a real system. I also employed the object-oriented programming, whereby I developed an abstract class to which I added several subclass to learn more about inheritance and polymorphism. There was also the lesson on how to design methods, overload them and work with various decision structures such as if-else and switch statements. The project enhanced my knowledge on array and methods of storing and manipulating data without databases. Another technique that I used to play it safe in case of errors is the implementation of custom exceptions and try-catch blocks. Lastly, the development of the menu-driven system allowed me to combine all the elements to a single operational system and to consider the way actual systems are designed.
